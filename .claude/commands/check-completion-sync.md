Check if shell completion is in sync with all commands and their subcommands. Fix if needed.

## Instructions

1. Read `src/branchctx/cmd_registry.py` to get all public commands
2. Read all files in `src/branchctx/commands/` to find subcommands
3. Read `src/branchctx/commands/completion.py` to check current completion coverage
4. For each command with subcommands, verify completion.py handles it

## How to detect subcommands

Look for patterns in command files:
- `if subcommand == "xxx"` or `elif subcommand == "xxx"`
- Help text showing available subcommands

## What to do

If everything is synced:
- Print: `✓ Shell completion is in sync`

If issues found:
1. Edit `src/branchctx/commands/completion.py` to add missing subcommands
2. Add to all 3 shells: zsh, bash, fish (follow existing patterns)
3. Create `.github/pr-description.md` with:

```markdown
## Summary

## Changes

4. Print: `✓ Fixed completion.py - created pr-description.md`

## Important

- Only check PUBLIC commands (from cmd_registry.COMMANDS)
- Skip internal commands (on-checkout, on-commit, sync)
- Follow existing code patterns in completion.py
